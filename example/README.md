# spotify_sdk_example

Demonstrates how to use the spotify_sdk plugin.

⚠️ Before running the app you have to edit the `.env` file in the root of the example project and add your own `CLIENT_ID` and `REDIRECT_URL` without surrounding quotes. Make sure that you don't push your credentials to a public repository.

If running on iOS you need to open the Xcode project and set the development team, bundle ID and the redirect URL scheme under "URL Types" as stated in the Spotify iOS SDK documentation.

```sh
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
REDIRECT_URL=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL
```
